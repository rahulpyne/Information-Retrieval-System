Weighted Derivation Trees

The nodes of a weighted derivation tree are associated
with weighting functions over the vocabulary 
of a context-free grammar.  An algorithm is presented
for constructing the optimal derivation tree having 
the same structure as a given weighted derivation tree.
 In addition, the correctness of the algorithm 
is established.  The method may be applied to problems
involving probabilistic parsing or combinatorial 
optimization.
