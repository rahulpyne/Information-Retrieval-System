High-Level Data Flow Analysis

In contrast to the predominant use of low-level
in termediate text, high-level data flow analysis 
deals with programs essentially at source level and
exploits the control flow information implicit in 
the parse tree.  The need for high-level flow analysis
arises from several aspects of recent work on 
advanced methods of program certification and optimization.
 This paper proposes a simple general method 
of high-level data flow analysis that allows free use
of escape and jump statements, avoids large graphs 
when compiling large programs, facilitates updating of
data flow information to reflect program changes, 
and derives new global information helpful in solving
many familiar global flow analysis problems.  An 
illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented.
 Many of the graphs involved are constructed 
and analyzed before any programs are compiled, thus avoiding
certain costs that low-level methods incur 
repeatedly at compile time.
