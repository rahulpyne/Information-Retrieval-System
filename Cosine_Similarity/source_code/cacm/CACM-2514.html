An Array Grammar Programming System

A package of Fortran programs has been developed
that permits a user to interactively design 
and test array grammars.  The user can control the rule
selection procedure in a derivation or parse, 
using weighted programming matrices; he also has a choice
of instance selection schemes (raster,random, 
parallel).  Examples are given involving array languages
consisting of simple geometrical patterns, as 
well as a language of "neuron pictures."
